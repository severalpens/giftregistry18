# Severalpens Gift Registry
## 2018 Edition



### Tech details
This was built off the back of a Visual Studio .Net Framework MVC template circa 2018. The database used is Sql Server.

- Clone repo
- Open in Visual Studio >= 2018
- Find and update any `<connectionStrings>`
	- Run Sql Server and connect to localhost using the 'Sever Explorer' window in VS. 
	- Right click on the connection and select 'properties' to get the correct connectionString.
- Set GR2018.UI as the startup project
- Run the application. Scaffolding will be triggered on the initial 'Register' which will build and populate the database.
